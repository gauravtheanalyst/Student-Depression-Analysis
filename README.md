# Student-Depression-Analysis
I recently completed a data analytics project analyzing a student depression dataset to uncover the key factors influencing mental health among students.
🔍 Key Insights:
💆‍♂️  The analysis revealed that students aged 20 to 40 showed a noticeably higher rate of depression, with male students being more affected compared to females in this age group.
👉 Among students aged 20 to 40, those with low study satisfaction reported a significantly higher rate of depression, suggesting that dissatisfaction with academic life plays a major role in mental health struggles.
👉 The data showed that students with longer study/work hours experienced higher levels of depression, highlighting the impact of academic overload on mental well-being.
💼 Academic Pressure and 📉 Low CGPA are strongly linked to depression levels.
😴 Students getting less than 5 hours of sleep showed a higher tendency toward depression.
👩‍🏫 Students currently in Class 12 exhibited higher depression rates compared to those in other educational levels, likely due to intense academic pressure and board exam stress.
🍽️ Those with moderate or unhealthy dietary habits had more frequent signs of mental stress.
💰 Financial stress was a common factor among students who reported suicidal thoughts.
🕒 Study hours beyond a certain threshold didn’t reduce depression — highlighting the need for balance.
